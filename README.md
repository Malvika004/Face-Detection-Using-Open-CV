**About cv2**

cv2 is the module import name for opencv-python, "Unofficial pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python".OpenCV has a function to read video, which is cv2. VideoCapture(). We can access our webcam using pass 0 in the function parameter. If you want to capture CCTV footage then we can pass RTSP url in the function parameter, which is really useful for video analysis.
